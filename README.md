This project was the first attempt to create a tool for generative movie editing. Videos can be re-edited based on their lines using these functions:
* play lines alphabetically sorted
* play only repeated lines
* play lines that contain a specific word or expression

The latest version includes a GUI and the option to re-edit more than one video at a time.

The application uses timestamps from subtitle files (.srt) to manipulate the videos.

More information about the process [here](http://gabrielmfadt.wordpress.com/tag/generative-movie-mashup/).

This project is a sequence of the [Movie Mashup as a Book](https://github.com/gianordoli/mashup), developed for the same class.

Made with [Processing](http://processing.org)

Some examples generated:
**All scenes from *The Wolf of Wall Street* containing the word ‘fuck’ — and its variations**
